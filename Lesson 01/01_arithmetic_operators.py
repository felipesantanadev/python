# Arithmetic Operators

#   +   (addition)
#   -   (subtraction)
#   /   (division)
#   *   (multiplication)
#   %   (mod -> rest of division)
#   **  (exponentiation)
#   //   (divides two numbers and rounds down the result to the nearest integer)

print(2 + 2)
print(7 - 2)
print(10 / 2)
print(2 * 3)
print(17 % 4)
print(2 ** 2)
print(7 // 2)

# Python also follow the mathematics rules about the oder of operations
# This will first sum the numbers and multiply after
print((2 + 4 + 6) * 2)

# This will first multiply 6*2 and sum the result of the multiplication with 2 + 4
print(2 + 4 + 6 * 2)
